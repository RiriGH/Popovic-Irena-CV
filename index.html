        <p>3D modeling of 3.5 km long pipeline system with referring structural
          elements and facilities. Final As-Built model was created according
          to all used standards and specifications, it contained more than
          200 000 modeled elements. Required accuracy was +/- 5 mm.</p>
        <h3>3D modeling of vessel in Oil Refinery Plant / October 2020 / Saudi Arabia</h3>
        <p>3D modeling of a vessel in oil refinery with exact positions of
            nozzles and valves for reparation was required. Final As-Built
            model was created according to all used standards and specifications.
             Preparation of cross-sectional plans and elevations.</p>
        <h3>Hail-Sakaka 620 km long pipeline corridor / February – June 2020 / Saudi Arabia</h3>
        <p>Production of Plan & Profile drawings for 620km long route for
          underground gas pipeline, production of digital topographic map and
          profile sections of the route.</p>
        <h3>Verticality of steel structures in Pancevo Refinery/ April – May 2020 / Pancevo, Serbia</h3>
        <p>Steel beams, steel structures and crane rails in oil refinery were
          modeled and from cross-sections on every 3m verticality/horizontality
          was checked. As-Built model was created according to all used standards
          and specifications. Technical and isometric drawings were extracted
          from model and represented as final product as well as accuracy calculation results.</p>

            represented as final product along with 3D As-Built model and
            visualization video.</p>
        <h3>3D Model and Surface flatness inspection of Hotel walls/ Spetember 2019/ Vranje, Serbia</h3>
        <p>Modeling of a Hotel with a requirement of inspection hallows and
           bumps on external hotel walls. Calculations and visual representation
           of wall’s irregularities were represented in final report.</p>
        <h3>3D Model of Perth Airport Terminal / August 2019/ Perth, Western Australia</h3>
        <p>Modeling of approximately 100m2 Airport Baggage Handling Areas (LOD 200)
           for reconstruction and reparation of Baggage belts. Final As-Built model
           was created according to all used standards and specifications.</p>
